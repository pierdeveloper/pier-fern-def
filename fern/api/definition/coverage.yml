            Under the Military Lending Act, loans to military personnel or their spouses
            and dependents cannot be made if the interest and expenses associated with the loan
            exceed an annual percentage rate (APR) of 36%. Due to these limits on military-related
            lending, we can't lend to members of the military or their spouses and dependents.
