  Reconciliation reports are used to reconcile the ledger and balance of facilities with partners' records.
  These reports come in (2) flavors served as JSON via the API: transactions and balances.
  Each report is generated for a specific facility each day and contains the balance EOD in Pacific Time and all transactions for that day.
  For any given day the reports will be ready by midday the following day.
  Transactions are broken up into (3) categories: payments, disbursements, and the ledger of the facility (which includes fees, interest, payments, disbursements, etc.).
  If the balances, transactions, payments, and disbursements in Pier's system match the partner's records, the partner can be confident that our systems are in sync.

  BalanceReport:
    properties:
      facility_id:
        type: facilities.FacilityId
        docs: The ID of the facility
      borrower_id:

      report_date:
        type: ISODate
        docs: The date of the report - this is the same as the date in the path parameter.
      balance:
        type: integer
        docs:  > 
          The balance EOD in Pacific Time in cents for the facility. 
          This field matches the facility balance field and handles 
          showing balance based on if the facility is in grace period 
          or not.
      payoff_balance:
        type: integer
        docs: >
          The payoff balance in cents for the facility. During grace 
          period this is the principal balance; out of grace this is 
          the current/total balance.
      current_balance:
        type: integer
        docs: >
          The current balance in cents for the facility. Regardless of 
          grace period this always includes the entire balance (principal,
          interest, fees).
      interest_balance:
        type: integer
        docs: >
          The interest balance in cents for the facility. This is the 
          interest accrued on the facility.
      in_grace_period:
        type: boolean
        docs: >
          A boolean indicating if the facility is in grace period. During grace
          period the payoff_balance is the facility's balance field and what is
          due without interest.
      in_introductory_promo_period:
        type: boolean
        docs: >
          A boolean indicating if the facility is in the introductory promo period.
          During this period the facility terms can be different than the standard
          terms once the grace period is over. Typically this would be a 0% interest
          for a period of X days.
