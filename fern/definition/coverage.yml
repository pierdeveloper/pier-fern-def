            Under the Military Lending Act, loans to military personnel or their
            spouses and dependents cannot be made if the interest and expenses
            associated with the loan exceed an annual percentage rate (APR) of
            36%. Due to these limits on military-related lending, we can't lend
            to members of the military or their spouses and dependents. Please
