  Borrowers represent a legal borrower, and can either be a consumer (e.g. for personal loans and lines of credit) or a [business](notion://www.notion.so/72a5b7a8b07d4bb983ae86a6b32d6696#5261b2cf754e453c8ad40b059ac0d584) (e.g. for commercial charge cards and loans). 
  Creating a borrower (or referencing an existing one) is the first step in the Pier credit origination process.
