Pier uses HTTP codes to indicate the status of an API request. Generally, `2xx` indicates success, `4xx` indicates something was wrong with the information provided, and `5xx` indicates something went wrong on Pier's servers.

### Attributes

- `error_type` string: The type of error, which can be one of `APPLICATION_ERROR`, `BORROWER_ERROR`, `LOAN_AGREEMENT_ERROR`, `INVALID_REQUEST_ERROR`, or `API_ERROR`.
- `error_code` string: The specific error that occurred, which can be used programmatically.
- `error_message` string: A human-readable error message for developers. These can change and should generally not be used programmatically.
- `error_detail` list of objects: In some cases, like a validation error, we'll return a list of objects with more information about the parameter that is invalid.

```js
{
    "error_type": "BORROWER_ERROR",
    "error_code": "INVALID_INPUT",
    "error_message": "A value provided in the body is incorrect. See error_detail for more",
    "error_detail": [
      {
        "value": "12708921",

        "param": "ein",
