This guide provides an introduction to getting started with our APIs.

## Environments

The Pier API is accessible in two environments:

| Environment | API url                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Sandbox     | `sandbox.pier-finance.com/api`           |
| Production  | `production.pier-finance.com/api`        |

The sandbox is designed to mimic the production environment, with a few exceptions. Loan agreements created in the sandbox will have large 'draft' watermarks and funds flows will only occur in production. Sandbox API keys are prefixed with `test_` while production API keys are prefixed with `prod_`. Otherwise, sandbox and production behavior is identical.

## Postman Collection

# TODO: update this section with new postman collection; pre-request script reference; and new variable setup; talk about hitting token endpoint

You can fork our [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/martian-comet-959825/workspace/pier-public/collection/14754440-cf96aaa5-d588-4a09-b4a0-66c32b77e33c?action=share&creator=14754440) to immediately start interacting with the API. You'll need to set a few variables to get started:

| Variable   | Description       |
|------------|-------------------|
| `client_id` | Your API client ID |
| `api_secret` | Your API secret     |
| `base_url`  | This should generally be set to `https://sandbox.pier-finance.com/api` |

## Authentication

Pier uses bearer auth to authenticate API requests. Call the [`/token`](/api-reference/auth/get-a-jwt-token) endpoint using `client_id` and `secret` in the post body to get a JWT token. The token should be included in the `Authorization` header of all subsequent requests in the format of `Bearer ${token}`.

## Rate limits and retrying API requests

Only 5xx (Server Errors) and 429 (Rate Limits) errors should be retried.

> Pier's rate limit is set to 1,000 requests per minute. The limit applies to both the sandbox and production environments. If a rate limit is triggered, we will respond with a 429 status code.

## High-level origination flow

The following diagram outlines how the Pier origination flow works with the Borrower, Application, Loan Agreement and Facility resources:

        "line_2": "Unit 220",
        "city": "Seattle",
        "state": "WA",
        "zip": "98101"
    },
    "date_of_birth": "1991-06-19",
    "email": "pmartin@email.com",
    "first_name": "Pierre",
    "last_name": "Martin",
    "ssn": "111111111",
    "kyc_completion_date": "2023-03-27"
}'
```

### Step 2: Create application

```shell
curl -X POST https://sandbox.pier-finance.com/api/applications \

    "credit_type": "consumer_installment_loan"
}'
```

### Step 3: Approve application

```shell
curl -X POST https://sandbox.pier-finance.com/api/applications/app_ae982db618544da9ac6fad552cede6f0/approve \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer ${PIER_ISSUED_JWT}' \
-d '{
    "offers":[{
        "amount": 2000000,
        "interest_rate": 1300,
        "payment_period": "monthly",
        "origination_fee": 0,
        "late_payment_fee": 0,
        "type": "loan_offer",
        "loan_term": {
            "term_type": "months",
            "term": 12
        }
    }]
}'
```

### Step 4: Create loan agreement

```shell
curl -X POST https://sandbox.pier-finance.com/api/loan_agreements \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer ${PIER_ISSUED_JWT}' \
-d '{
    "application_id": "app_ae982db618544da9ac6fad552cede6f0",
    "accepted_offer_id": "off_b71c4524ac57467e982ce5414800c27f"
}'
```

### Step 5: Sign loan agreement

```shell
curl -X POST https://sandbox.pier-finance.com/api/loan_agreements/doc_6f9c7af667024d5f837ae5a0fb942a8a/sign \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer ${PIER_ISSUED_JWT}' \
-d '{}'
```

### Step 6. Create credit facility

```shell
curl -X POST https://sandbox.pier-finance.com/api/facilities \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer ${PIER_ISSUED_JWT}' \
-d '{
    "loan_agreement_id": "doc_6f9c7af667024d5f837ae5a0fb942a8a"
}'
```
