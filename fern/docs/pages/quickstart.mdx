# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This guide provides an introduction to getting started with our APIs.

# Environments 

The Pier API is accessible in two environments:

| Environment | API url                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Sandbox     | `sandbox.pier-finance.com/api`           |
| Production  | `production.pier-finance.com/api`        |

The sandbox is designed to mimic the production environment, with a few exceptions. Loan agreements created in the sandbox will have large 'draft' watermarks and funds flows will only occur in production. Sandbox API keys are prefixed with `test_` while production API keys are prefixed with `prod_`. Otherwise, sandbox and production behavior is identical.

### Postman Collection

You can fork our Postman collection to immediately start interacting with the API. You'll need to set a few variables to get started:

| Variable   | Description       |
|------------|-------------------|
| `client_id` | Your API client ID |
| `api_secret` | Your API secret     |
| `base_url`  | This should generally be set to `https://sandbox.pier-finance.com/api` |

### Authentication

Pier uses basic auth to authenticate API requests. All calls should be made with the `username` field set to your `client_id` and the `password` field set to your `api_secret`.

## Rate limits and retrying API requests

Only 5xx (Server Errors) and 429 (Rate Limits) errors should be retried.

> Pier's rate limit is set to 1,000 requests per minute. The limit applies to both the sandbox and production environments. If a rate limit is triggered, we will respond with a 429 status code.

## High-level origination flow

```

### Step 5: Sign loan agreement

```shell

### Step 6. Create credit facility

```shell
