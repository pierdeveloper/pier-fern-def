Pier's Pilot Mode allows you to use Pier for ledgering and compliance without Pier's funds flow or lender licenses - in
this mode, you serve as the lender of record.

## Included Features
- Origination
- Loan document generation
- Ledgering
- Loan compliance using unlicensed state requirements by default

## Excluded Features
- Funds Flow
- Statement generation
- Pier's Lending Licenses

## Licensing
If you obtain a lending license for one or more states, please [get in touch](mailto:support@pier-finance.com) with Pier to have your account configured
to use licensed state requirements where appropriate when assessing loan compliance.

## Getting started
In order to operate in pilot mode, you must set your contact details in order to serve as lender of record. Please see
the [`/configuration/lending_details`](/api-reference/configuration/set-lending-details) for more information. You must
set your details before you can run the origination flow in Pier. After that, you may use the Pier API as normal -
see the [quickstart](/overview/quickstart) section for more information. Remember, you must handle disbursements and
payments yourself.

If you wish to upgrade the product to take advantage of Pier's funds flow and lending licenses, please [get in touch](mailto:support@pier-finance.com).
